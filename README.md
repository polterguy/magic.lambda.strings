# Magic Lambda Strings

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.strings.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.strings)

String manipulation library for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically, it gives you the following slots.

* __[strings.replace]__ - Replaces occurrencies of the specified argument with the value of its specified argument.
* __[strings.replace-not-of]__ - Replaces all characters found in string, except those found in its single argument.
* __[strings.capitalize]__ - Turns the first character in your string into a CAPS.
* __[strings.concat]__ - Concatenates two or more strings.
* __[strings.contains]__ - Returns true if specified string contains the given argument.
* __[strings.ends-with]__ - Returns true if the specified string ends with the specified argument.
* __[strings.starts-with]__ - Returns true if the specified string starts with its argument.
* __[strings.join]__ - Joins multiple strings together, with a separating character between each.
* __[strings.length]__ - Returns the length in characters of the given string.
* __[strings.regex-replace]__ - Replaces occurrencies matching the given regular expression with its argument.
* __[strings.split]__ - Splits a string into multiple strings on every match of its given argument
* __[strings.to-lower]__ - Returns the lower caps version of its given argument
* __[strings.to-upper]__ - Returns the upper caps version of its specified argument.
* __[strings.trim]__ - Trims a string, optionally for all characters found in its argument.
* __[strings.trim-start]__ - Trims a string only to its left, optionally for all characters found in its argument.
* __[strings.trim-end]__ - Trims a string only to its right, optionally for all characters found in its argument.

## Usage

All the above slots that requires two arguments, will use the first argument as its _"what"_ argument, and the second
as its _"with"_ argument. Avoiding naming these though, allows you to reference other slots, and use these as sources
to parametrize your invocations to the above slots.

### strings.replace

This slot replaces occurrencies of a string inside a string, with some other string. The simplest version is like
follows.

```
/*
 * This will replace "hansen" with "tjobing hansen".
 */
.foo:thomas hansen
strings.replace:x:-
   .:hansen
   .:tjobing hansen
```

You can also reference slots and dynamic slots for that matter, assuming your slots somehow returns strings,
or something that can be converted into a string, such as the following illustrates.

```
/*
 * This will replace "hansen" with "tjobing hansen".
 */
.what:hansen
.foo:thomas hansen
strings.replace:x:-
   get-value:x:@.what
   signal:some-slot-returning-string
      arg1-to-slot:foo
      arg2-to-slot:foo
```

Above the first argument is _"what to look for"_, and the second argument is _"what to substitute it with"_.

The above is a general pattern for most of these slots, where the node arguments supplied to the slot will be
evaluated as a lambda object, before the arguments are consumed, allowing you to use arguments that are the
result of invoking other slots as arguments to your original outer most slot.

### strings.replace-not-of

This slot will replace every single character in your original string, that cannot be found in its second
argument. This is useful if you want to remove all characters that cannot be found in another character set,
such as the following illustrates.

```
strings.replace-not-of:foo bar1howdy
   .:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   .:-
```

The above will result in the following result `strings.replace-not-of:foo bar-howdy`

### strings.capitalize

Turns the first character of your string into a CAPS character.

```
strings.capitalize:thomas

/*
 * Resulting in "Thomas" after invocation.
 */
```

### strings.concat

Concatenates a list of strings into one string. Similar to **[strings.join]**, except it doesn't take a
separating character.

```
.bar:Bar
strings.concatenate
   .:Thomas
   .:Hansen
   .:Foo
   get-value:x:@.bar

/*
 * Resulting in "Thomas Hansen Foo Bar" after invocation.
 */
```

### strings.contains

Returns true if the specified string contains some sequence of characters.

```
// Returns true
strings.contains:Thomas Hansen Is Cool
   .:Hansen
```

### strings.ends-with

Returns true if the specified string ends with some sequence of characters.

```
// Returns true
strings.ends-with:Thomas Hansen Is Cool
   .:Cool

// Returns false
strings.ends-with:Thomas Hansen Is Coolio
   .:Cool
```

### strings.starts-with

Returns true if the specified string starts with some sequence of characters.

```
// Returns true
strings.ends-with:Thomas Hansen Is Cool
   .:Thomas

// Returns false
strings.ends-with:Thomas Hansen Is Cool
   .:Hansen
```

### strings.join

Similar to **[strings.concat]**, except it also takes an optional separating character, allowing you to
concatenate a bunch of strings, and making sure each original string is separated by some sequence of strings.

```
.src
   .:foo
   .:bar
strings.join:x:@.src/*
   .:,

/*
 * Results becomes "foo, bar"
 */
```

### strings.length

Returns the length of a string as an integer number.

```
// Returns 6
strings.length:thomas
```

### strings.regex-replace

Replaces matches of the given regular expression with some static sequence of characters.

```
// Results in "FOO bar hansen"
strings.regex-replace:foo bar hansen
   .:fo+
   .:FOO
```

The first argument is what regular expression to match, the second argument is what to replaces
all matches with.

### strings.split

Splits a string into multiple strings, where a sequence of characters can be found, removing the original
sequence of characters from the resulting node set.

```
.foo:some input string
strings.split:x:-
   .:' '
```

The above will result in the following result.

```
.foo:some input string
strings.split:x:-
   .:some
   .:input
   .:string
```

### strings.to-lower

Turns every single character in your input string into a lowercase character.

```
strings.to-lower:Thomas Hansen Is Cool

// Results in "thomas hansen is cool"
```

### strings.to-upper

Turns every single character in your input string into a UPPER case character.

```
strings.to-upper:Thomas Hansen Is Cool

// Results in "THOMAS HANSEN IS COOL"
```

### strings.trim, strings.trim-start, strings.trim-end

Trims a string, either both sides, only the start of it, or only the end of it, for
occurrencies of characters found in the sequence of characters provided as its argument.

```
strings.trim:09thomas12
   .:1234567890

// Results in "thomas"
```
